A simple project based on a Movie Ticket Booking System which uses Python Language with MySQL Database. The system manages the details of Shows, Booking, Movie and Customer. It also manages all the information about seat selection and pricing. Itâ€™s the same as real-life scenarios and well-implemented on it.
[Here are screenshots of the working code for the system](https://github.com/deninjo/Booking-system/blob/master/Screenshots/README.md)
